This will be as close as possible to an objective analysis of geopolitics. My goal is not to make a case for any particular politician or policy or to glorify or demonize any particular country or group of countries. We often fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing countries. Countries are not people. They make highly calculated and rational foreign policy decisions, whether moral or otherwise. Their very continued existence depends on this.

A spectre is haunting Europe. Specifically the spectre of a second Trump administration.

The 2024 election has been one that observers in Europe have not been looking forward to. The reason for this anxiety is the uncertainty that existed coming into the election. Unlike the 2020 election in which most people expected Biden to defeat Trump, the 2024 election has been far more tumultuous and uncertain. Going into election day, most polls left the race up to a coin flip. For the European security community, the stakes couldn't be higher. Kamala Harris essentially ran on a continuation of Biden's strong support for NATO and Ukraine. Trump, on the other hand ran under an "America First" platform based on weaker support of Ukraine and NATO.

This sense of dread turned into panic as the election results started coming in. Trump was decisively elected president, defying most polls that predicted a close race. In a record landslide, Trump won over every single swing state and managed to be the first republican in 20 years to win the popular vote. This overwhelming electoral mandate now gives Trump room to enact his most extreme policies. He will no doubt additionally be helped by the new republican trifecta in congress and domination of the supreme court.

However, have European observers overreacted? How much of Trump's populist rhetoric will really translate into his policy?

## The General Outlook

It's useful not to sugarcoat this - Trump's victory is not good for you if you are a fan of NATO or American protection of Ukraine and Europe. The most optimistic best case scenario is that Trump will be a net neutral for these issues, unceremoniously continuing Biden's policies. In the worst case, America will completely pull back from the world, irreversibly damaging American power and influence on the world stage and paving the road to an even more difficult war for Ukraine. Europe will be in severe trouble if Donald Trump pulls out of NATO and a continent-wide reckoning over security will have to happen. 

However, neither of these extreme scenarios are likely to happen. Whatever does happen still likely won't be what most European leaders wanted.

## (Ending) The War in Ukraine

When it comes to the war in Ukraine, the Ukrainians defines victory as moving the line of control all the way back to internationally recognized Ukraine. In other words, no inch of Ukraine would be occupied by Russia. To put it simply, this is an unachievable goal. Even with billions of dollars of Western aid, the best Ukraine can do is to stem Russian progress and to freeze the lines of fighting to the best of its ability. Additionally, the future of this war does not look bright for Ukraine. Russia has the luxury of a vastly bigger population, which means that Ukraine will certainly loose the longer the war goes on as it runs out of military-aged men. Even the Russian economy is doing fine despite historic sanctions. 

Anyone who says that Ukraine will win this war is either engaged in wishful thinking or is lying to themselves. As it turns out, the world is not like a Disney movie. Aggressors are not always valiantly defeated by the little guy. Little guys loose because they are little and aggressors win most of the time because they would not have become aggressors if their loss was guaranteed. 

Now the goal of the current US involvement is to punish Russia for violating international n orms
